# general rules to follow when building graphics
# book beautiful evidence by Edward Tufte

# 1. show comparisons
# evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing hypothesis
# control home vs air cleaner homes

# 2. show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
# what's the causal framework
# why does air cleaner cause a better env
# particulate matter between control vs air cleaner
# how world works

# 3. show multivariate data
# more than 2 variables, real world is multivariate
# tell richer story

# 4. Integrate evidence
# integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
# don't let tool drive the analysis

# 5. Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc

# 6. Content is king
# tell an interesting story
# be critical of quality, relevance and integrity
